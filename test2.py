test_text = '''As part of our team's continuous learning and skill assessment, I’d like
you to complete the following tasks in preparation for the upcoming mock
test. This will help us ensure that you’re comfortable with the key
concepts and prepared to perform well.
Please complete the following by next week:
   - *Code Review Preparation*: Identify three recent code snippets you
   worked on that could use further optimization. Prepare notes on what
   changes you would make and why.
   - *Algorithm Analysis*: Review the list of algorithms we covered last
   quarter. Focus on identifying areas where you could improve efficiency in
   your solutions, particularly with sorting and searching algorithms.
   - *Mock Test Practice Questions*: Spend some time working through mock
   test questions on [platform or resource name] focused on data structures
   (stacks, queues, trees) and algorithms (binary search, recursion).
   - *Documentation Review*: Check the documentation for one of the core
   services you frequently work with. Note any areas where you feel more
   understanding is needed, and outline questions to discuss in our next 1:1.
   - *Self-Assessment*: After completing the above, draft a brief
   self-assessment, including strengths, any areas for improvement, and
   specific goals for the mock test.
Please let me know if you need any resources or have questions about the
assignments.'''
